# bloodbank-php
A Online Blood Bank Management System Project In PHP allows the blood bankâ€™s management to access the data because the system focuses only on the data management or the inventory of the blood availability in a certain blood bank. This system stores the list of donors, blood donations, requests and hands over requested blood.
